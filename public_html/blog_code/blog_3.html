        <div>
            <p class="description">There are tons of great ways to use Shared Journals in the Day One app — and one of our<br>
                favorites (do we have to pick a favorite?) is taking the chaos out of group trip planning to make<br>
                sure everyone’s on the same page. From sharing itineraries and packing lists to compiling<br>
                photos, a Shared Journal for a trip keeps everything you need to plan, execute, and reflect on a<br>
                trip in one place. Here’s how!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="h2_1">
            <h2>1. Create and Name a New Shared Journal</h2>
            <p class="h2p">Name your journal, choose a color, and include a description, if you’d like. You can always<br>
                come back and edit these choices later.
            </p>

        <div class="h2_2">
            <h2>2. Invite Contributors to Your Shared Journal</h2>
            <p class="h2p">You can include up to 29 people (besides you!) in your Shared Journal. Go ahead and<br>
                copy/paste the link; you can invite contributors via text or email. Remember: these contributors<br>
                will be able to edit entries and create new entries, but they won’t have access to any of your<br>
                private journal entries. Those are just for you!
            </p>

            <h2>3. Create Your First Entry, or Choose a<br> Template</h2>
            <p class="h2p">Just like with private journals, from here, the world is your oyster. Create a new journal entry<br>
                from scratch, start with a photo or audio recording, choose from Day One’s journal template<br>
                options, or use a template you’ve created previously.

            <h2>4. Start planning!</h2>
            <p class="h2p">Here, we started with a packing list. Aunt Blair will never forget her sunscreen again! You might<br>
                also scan and upload travel itineraries, drop links to reservation confirmations, or share images<br>
                of beaches you want to be sure to visit, restaurants you can’t miss, or activities you definitely<br>
                want to fit in.

        <div class="h2_5">
            <h2>5. Enjoy your trip!</h2>
            <p class="h2p">You’ve planned, you’ve packed, and you’ve made it. Now it’s time for each member of the<br>
                journal to document the trip, with photos, text, voice recordings, and more. This is everyone’s<br>
                opportunity to share how they experience the time together: the moments that matter, for any<br>
                reason, no matter how small. You’ll end up with a diverse combination of memories<br>
                — something you’ll all be able to look back on for years to come.
