                Keeping tabs of your daily moods and feelings is a great way to improve self-awareness, take<br>
                stock of patterns, and better understand the goings on of your inner mind. There are plenty of<br>
                ways to do this in the Day One app—if you’re just getting started, you can take advantage of<br>
                our existing templates and go from there!
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, we’ll walk you through setting up and customizing a mood tracker within the Day<br>
                One app, including setting up reminders to keep your practice, and more helpful tips.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s get going.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div_h2">
            <h2>Step 1: Create a new journal.</h2>
            <p>You can also select a time to be reminded to complete your entry—you’ll get a notification,<br>
                which can help you create and maintain a habit.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Navigate to Templates.</h2>
            <img src="blog10_img2.webp" alt="">
            
            <h2>Step 3: Scroll to the Health & Wellness<br> section, and choose the Mood Tracker<br> template.</h2>
            <img src="blog10_img3.webp" alt="">
            
            <h2>Step 4: Save the template to your templates.</h2>
            <p>You can also choose “use now” to get started with your first mood tracker entry right now!</p>
            <img src="blog10_img4.webp" alt="">
            
            <h2>Step 5: Select your mood.</h2>
            <p>
                How are you feeling today? The template comes with a whole lot of emotions to choose from<br>
                —but you can also add your own, if these don’t cut it.
            </p>
            <img src="blog10_img5.webp" alt="">
            
            <h2>Step 6: Explore your mood with written<br> reflections.</h2>
            <p>
                The template includes guided prompts to help you explore your current mood, like “What<br>
                might have triggered this mood?” and “How am I responding to my mood?” Answering these<br>
                questions can help you understand how you respond to certain situations and to gather ideas<br>
                for actions you can take.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 7: Repeat!</h2>
            <p>
                Schedule a mood check-in any time you like. Using journaling notifications, you can pair a<br>
                custom message like, “How am I feeling right now?” to your mood tracker template. Simply tap<br>
                the notification to check in on how you’re feeling.
