                The beginning of the year is the perfect time to reflect on the past and set intentions for the<br>
                future. And what better way to do that than with journaling? There are lots of ways to reflect on<br>
                the year and plan for what’s next in your journal; we’ll share some recommendations and<br>
                prompts—but think of this as a jumping off point. It’s your year, and you’re in charge of what<br>
                you plan to make of it!

            <ul>
                <li><b>Lessons Learned:</b> Consider the lessons you’ve learned throughout the year. How have<br>
                    these lessons shaped you? Reflecting on your experiences can help you make more<br>

            <h2>Setting Goals for 2024</h2>
            <p>The start of a new year is also a great time and setting intentions for the year ahead.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Vision Board Journaling:</b> Create a vision board in your journal by describing your ideal<br>
                    life in 2024. What do you want to achieve, and how do you envision your year<br>
                    unfolding? Use words, drawings, quotes, or images to bring your vision to life.

                    goals for the new year. Break down your larger aspirations into smaller, actionable steps<br>
                    to make them more manageable and achievable. For example, instead of “I hope to walk<br>
                    more,” try: “I plan to walk 10,000 steps a day in order to improve my physical health and<br>
                    mood. I’ll break up my walks in three chunks: after breakfast, after lunch, and before<br>
                    dinner. I’ll track my steps with my fitness watch.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Choose a Word of the Year:</b> Choose a word that encapsulates your intentions for the<br>
                    upcoming year. This can serve as a guiding principle for your actions and decisions. You<br>
                    could also choose an image, color, or mantra for the year if that better suits your plans<br>
                    and intentions.

                    milestones throughout the year. What did you learn from achieving a goal or facing a<br>
                    setback? Regular reflection keeps you connected to your journey.
