                Have you ever wanted to stop time so you could journal in the moment? Maybe you’re at<br>
                a party, and you say something you regret. In an ideal world, you could pause, spend twenty<br>
                minutes metabolizing whatever happened in your journal, then go back to the party, feeling<br>
                revived. Or maybe your kid says something hilarious, and you want to remember it—not just<br>
                the quote, but the beautiful sunshine, the delicious picnic, and all the other special details of<br>
                that moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure, you could pull out your Day One app in these moments and jot down a note to yourself<br>
                right from your phone. But sometimes, it’s easier to just send a quick text: maybe you don’t<br>
                want someone looking over your shoulder and asking what on earth you’re doing (it’s easier to<br>
                say: “oh, I’m just texting a friend!” than “I’m journaling on the go!”—although, if that’s you,<br>
                more power to you). Or perhaps you find it easier to journal as a text response to a reminder,<br>
                compared to opening the app and starting from scratch.

                In this article, we’ll walk you through how to journal with SMS, including text reminders to keep<br>
                you honest with your daily journaling journey.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s how to get started.</p>

        <div class="div_h2">
            <h2>Step 1: Navigate to Settings, and Select ‘SMS<br> to Journal’</h2>
            <img src="blog11_img1.png">
            
            <h2>Step 2: Give Day One Permission to Send You<br> Texts</h2>
            You can also set up Daily Text Reminders, if you’d like; it can be helpful to pick a time when you<br>
            know you’ll typically need to step back and take a moment to reflect, like at the end of a work<br>
            day, or first thing when you wake up.

            <h2>Step 3: Check Your Texts</h2>
            <p>You should have one from Day One!</p>
            <img src="blog11_img3.webp" alt="">
            
            <h2>Step 4: Respond</h2>
            <p>
                Respond whenever you want, however you want. It will look like you’re just dashing off a quick<br>
                text, when really, you could be journaling about anything that’s on your mind.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 5: Open the Day One App</h2>
            <p>
                You should see your text as a new journal entry. Continue it any time. Happy journaling!
